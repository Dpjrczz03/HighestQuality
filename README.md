# HighestQuality
Youtube doesn't contain highest quality selector in settings in pc. Therefore, i have made a background running code that toggles the highest available quality for a youtube video, whenever a new video is played.


For the code to work, make sure to open chrome browser with port=2407 via cmd

in cmd, type

cd (location of chrome.exe)
chrome.exe --remote-debugging-port=2407



This will open a chrome window, in which this code will work.
make sure the code is running in the background.
